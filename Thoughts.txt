I will map my thought process in this file.

1) Understanding the task description & quick solution brainstorming
 - Copying a folder seems like an easy task (at first), but there some hidden traps and problems to overcome
 - I will start small with obvious (happy path) parts of the task and then refine the solution as I face the individual obstacles
 - Each iteration should be executable and testable, made into a seperate git commit to track the progress

2) "Fight" plan
 - Create console project
 - Handle the command arguments
 - Deal with directories
 - Deal with copying new/changed files/folders
 - Deal with removing old files/folders
 - Add timer
 - Add logging
 - Think about edge cases (locked files, hidden files, ...)
    - hidden & readonly files are copied as well
 - Add exception handling
 - Refactor the whole solution to a presentable form
 - Add comments
 - Write final report and explanation of the solution

3) Notes
 - What if the interval is shorter than the lenght of the sync process?
 - Could/Should the user add missing arguments at runtime?
 - Check for enough disk space?
 - Exit on error? Or continue...
 - Log each sync iteration to a separate file? or have just one file...
 - Should add some kind of testing suite - but that would a bigger project...

4) Final words
Very interesting task, I enjoyed it.
Spent around a manday (8h) on the solution.
The whole genesis can be seen through the git log.
Thank you for the opportunity.
